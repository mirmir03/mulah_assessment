# Mulah Assessment – Table Input & Processing

This project was created as part of a technical assessment for a software engineering internship at Mulah. The goal is to take input from a provided table (Table 1), display it on a webpage, and compute additional values for Table 2 based on that data.

---

## Project Overview

- **Table 1** displays raw values from the provided dataset.
- **Table 2** computes the following:
  - **Alpha** = A5 + A20
  - **Beta** = A15 / A7
  - **Charlie** = A13 * A12

The calculated values are dynamically extracted and displayed as integers using JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the webpage
- **CSS** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – DOM manipulation and data processing
